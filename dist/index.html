               <br/>
               In the spring of 2019, the world saw the first image of a black hole, through the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration. As a postdoctoral fellow at MIT, Dr. Bouman contributed to the project’s success through 
               six years of work on mission-critical algorithms used to process massive amounts of data collected by EHT’s strategically-positioned network of eight international radio observatories. Dr. Bouman is an inspiration to 
               people everywhere, especially women working in STEM. According to her, “a career in science means working with people around the world. It’s going to telescopes at 15,000 feet. It’s working toward making the first image
